# Autism Detector using Machine Learning ðŸ§ 

This project focuses on the development of an **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) detection** tool using machine learning techniques. By analyzing behavioral and screening data, this model provides predictions that could assist in early identification of autism in individuals.

The model leverages the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm**, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks. It has been meticulously trained and evaluated on real-world datasets, ensuring reliable performance across various test cases.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Robust handling of missing values using imputation techniques to ensure clean and consistent data for model training.
- **Modeling:** The KNN classifier is fine-tuned to optimize accuracy while balancing computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Comprehensive evaluation using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports to assess model performance.
- **User-Friendly:** The notebook is well-documented and includes step-by-step guidance, making it easy to understand for both beginners and experts in the field of machine learning and autism research.

This tool aims to contribute to the early detection of autism by providing a scalable, machine-learning-based approach, empowering healthcare professionals and researchers to make informed decisions with data-driven insights.
